    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The lasagna emerged from the oven bubbling and fragrant, 
        layers of tender pasta embracing a rich meat sauce simmered with tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. 
        Creamy ricotta and silky béchamel melted together, 
        while golden mozzarella formed a lightly crisp top that promised comfort in every bite.</p>
    <p>Each forkful delivered warmth and balance the savory depth of the sauce, 
        the soft pasta, and the gentle creaminess of the cheese working in perfect harmony. 
        It was the kind of lasagna that lingered on the palate and in memory, satisfying, hearty, and undeniably comforting.
