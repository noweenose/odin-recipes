    <h1> Spaghetti Carbonara </h1>
    <img src="../recipe-images/spagheticarbonara.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Golden and bubbling straight from the oven, baked mac is the definition of comfort food. 
        Tender elbow pasta is coated in a rich, velvety cheese sauce, 
        often made from sharp cheddar that melts into every curve and crevice. 
        As it bakes, the top transforms into a lightly crisp, golden crust, sometimes finished with buttery breadcrumbs, 
        while the inside stays creamy and indulgent. Each spoonful balances warmth,
         savoriness, and nostalgia, filling the kitchen with an inviting aroma that promises pure, satisfying comfort.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
        <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>    
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>        
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</li>
        <li>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</li>
    </ol>
