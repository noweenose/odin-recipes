    <h1> Baked Mac</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Golden and bubbling straight from the oven, baked mac is the definition of comfort food. 
        Tender elbow pasta is coated in a rich, velvety cheese sauce, 
        often made from sharp cheddar that melts into every curve and crevice. 
        As it bakes, the top transforms into a lightly crisp, golden crust, sometimes finished with buttery breadcrumbs, 
        while the inside stays creamy and indulgent. Each spoonful balances warmth,
         savoriness, and nostalgia, filling the kitchen with an inviting aroma that promises pure, satisfying comfort.
